CSS adds styling to content

As a rule, HTML and CSS should remain separate


==ELEMENTS

The part (element name) between <>

Ex. <a>


==TAGS

The combination of the element name and the <>

Content is usually sourrounded by an opening tag <> and a closing tag </>

Ex. <a>...</a>

Selfclosing tags are possible


==ATTRIBUTES

Properties that provide additional information about an element

They reside in the opening tag and follow the format: name="value"

Ex. <a href="...">...</a>

    <head></head>
    <body></body>
  </html>
