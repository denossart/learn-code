==LANGUAGE
HTML is a declarative language

No need to run the code: you tell the browser what to do, not how to do it


==PURPOSE
HTML adds structure and meaning to content

CSS adds styling to content

As a rule, HTML and CSS should remain separate


==ELEMENTS
The combination of an HTML opening tag, content and closing tag

Ex. <p>This is a paragraph</p>

--BLOCK-LEVEL
--INLINE-LEVEL


==TAGS

The combination of the element name and the <>

Content is usually sourrounded by an opening tag <> and a closing tag </>

Ex. <a>...</a>

Selfclosing tags are possible


==ATTRIBUTES

Properties that provide additional information about an element

They reside in the opening tag and follow the format: name="value"

Ex. <a href="...">...</a>


==REQUIRED STRUCTURE

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head></head>
    <body></body>
  </html>

--Head
Not displayed on the web page
----Title
----Metadata
----External links

--Body
The visible part of the web page


==HEADING HIERARCHY

--Avoid paragraph skipping


==SEMANTICS



==VALIDATORS

Scans code for errors


==LINKS

--Relative links

No domain name needed

--Absolute links

----rowspan="..."
Ex.: an event on a calendar that spans multiple hours

--<tbody> - <thead> - <tfoot>

Each requires a <tr>
